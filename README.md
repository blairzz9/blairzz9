**MSc Neuroscience student at KCL** :brain:


I'm currently pursuing a master's in neuroscience at King's College London.


I have a background in finance and behavioral economics, and I am exploring the intersection of neuroscience and AI to model higher cognitive processes such as memory and consciousness. My work involves using computational modeling to study human decision-making.
