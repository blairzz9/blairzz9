I'm currently pursuing a master's in neuroscience at King's College London, with a strong interest in computational neuroscience, decision-making, and neuroeconomics. My research focuses on understanding the computational model of decision-making, particularly in model-based and model-free decision-making.

I have a background in finance and behavioral economics, and I am exploring the intersection of neuroscience and AI to model higher cognitive processes such as memory and consciousness. My work involves using computational modeling to study human decision-making.

ðŸ”¬ Research Interests

Computational models of decision-making
Neuroeconomics & reinforcement learning
Memory & consciousness emergence
fMRI & EEG in human cognition

ðŸ“¬ Let's connect!

Feel free to reach out if youâ€™re interested in collaborating on neuroscience, AI, or decision-making research.
